# Law-Application
customised llm for Indian law 
=======
# Legal RAG Starter (Indian Law)

A minimal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) backend you can run locally. It indexes local legal text files and retrieves relevant snippets via a simple FastAPI service.

This is a practical first step before moving to on-device LLMs.

## What’s included
- FastAPI server with two endpoints: `/ingest` and `/query`
- Lightweight TF‑IDF vector store (no heavy ML deps)
- Sample legal text to test
- Scripts to index and query
- Docs with legal disclaimers and a phased plan
- Placeholder mobile-app folder for future client work

## Quick start
See `docs/project_plan.md` for the roadmap and "Try it" commands at the end of this README once dependencies are installed.

## Disclaimer
The content and outputs are for informational purposes only and are not legal advice. See `docs/legal_disclaimers.md`.
